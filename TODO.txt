- work with the board file to read the currect state of the board
	- we decided not to proceed with this as it can work out of memory
- eventually accept the next position from IO

2021-08-03
- Review the last two tests. We implemented that knowing it is not going to be the expected output after flipping is implemented.
- Review the lists (black, white, and blank) and make sure our new implementation impact their correctness.

- [X] We should review Direction class, maybe add property for each direction, or use Dictionary again
- [ ] We talked about collecting squares on each direction, and either flipping them or diposing them as we reach the end of the path

2021-08-17
- We refactored Direction class and added properties for each direction
- We refactored Game, made it easier to read and ready for accepting directions
- We ended RED. Maybe we want to comment out the last test until we are done with following refactoring.
- [ ] Change properties of Direction class from int[] to a new type (e.g. Vector {Row, Column}). We need to think about the name for the new type.
- [X] We can change the Board to collection of Squares
- [ ] We can add an ADD operation to Square class
- [ ] We can implement the logic to check different directions


2021-08-24
- We commnetted out the failing test
- We replaced char[,] with Square[,] in Board and made the changes in other classes
- We move UpdateSquare from Game to Board
- [ ] Now that Square has a new property as Colour, maybe we should revisit list of White, Black, and Blank, and check for possibility of improvements.
